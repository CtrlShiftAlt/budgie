## Ancient Totem, Mysterious Symbol

Among the twelve zodiac animals in ancient China, the snake, with its unique posture and deep-set eyes, tells tales about life and time. Since ancient times, the snake has been regarded as a mysterious and sacred creature on the vast land of China. In primitive society, out of reverence and awe for natural forces, people worshipped the snake as a totem. In many ancient rock paintings and murals, we can find images of snakes, either coiled on mountain rocks or weaving through jungles, displaying an inexplicable mysterious power.

In the eyes of ancients, the snake had the amazing ability to communicate with heaven and earth and predict the future. Legends say that the ancestors of humanity, Fuxi and Nuwa, both had human heads and snake bodies. They created humanity, taught people fishing, hunting, farming, and other survival skills, and ushered in the dawn of Chinese civilization. This image not only reflects the ancients' admiration for snakes but also symbolizes the close connection between snakes and the origin and reproduction of humanity. Therefore, in the Year of the Snake, people often hold a special sentiment for snakes, viewing them as symbols of wisdom and mystery.

## Colorful Celebrations

The arrival of the Year of the Snake is always accompanied by a series of colorful celebrations. In the fields of the countryside, teams of dragon dances with straw dragons march slowly under the night sky, bringing endless joy and hope to this land. This is a traditional custom that has been handed down for a long time, aiming to pray for good weather and abundant harvests in the new year. The straw dragon, woven from straw and adorned with burning incense sticks, resembles a winding galaxy illuminating the night sky. Villagers hold up the straw dragon, accompanied by exciting drumbeats and joyful suona horn music, marching along village roads. Wherever they go, fireworks explode and firecrackers crackle, pushing the festive atmosphere to a climax.

In some remote mountainous areas, the custom of hanging snake paintings has been handed down for a long time. Before the Spring Festival, every household will carefully select a snake painting with auspicious meanings and hang it in a prominent position at the gate or in the main room. These paintings sometimes depict agile snakes weaving through flower bushes, dancing with butterflies and bees, symbolizing the harmony and beauty of life; sometimes, they show snakes accompanied by turtles, cranes, and other auspicious creatures, symbolizing longevity and good fortune. Each snake painting carries people's good wishes for the new year and reflects the sacred status of snakes in people's hearts.

Besides dragon dances with straw dragons and hanging snake paintings, there are many other interesting celebrations in the Year of the Snake. For example, in some places, people will hold traditional activities such as guessing lantern riddles, setting off firecrackers, and lion dances during the Spring Festival to add to the festive atmosphere. In some ethnic minority areas, there are unique snake year sacrifice rituals, where people pray for peace and happiness by worshipping snake deities. These celebrations not only enrich the cultural connotations of the Year of the Snake but also make people feel the strong festive atmosphere in this special year.

## Food and Cultural Blend

In the Spring Festival of the Year of the Snake, food is also indispensable. In some southern regions, "Five-Snake Soup" has become a highly sought-after traditional delicacy. Although this dish is not actually made from the meat of five different snakes, the auspicious number "five" symbolizes five blessings. People enjoy this delicious soup, not only satisfying their taste buds but also feeling the anticipation and longing for a new life in their hearts.

Besides Five-Snake Soup, there are many other snake-related foods that are popular in the Year of the Snake. For example, in some places, people use snake meat to make various delicious dishes, such as snake soup, snake stew, and snake skin. These dishes not only have unique flavors but also contain rich nutritional value. While enjoying these foods, people also feel the unique charm and allure brought by the Year of the Snake.

Of course, while enjoying food, we cannot forget to respect and protect snakes. As a precious wild animal resource, snakes play an important role in ecological balance.
